## Configuration Guide

The application uses several configuration options that can be customized by modifying the appropriate files.

### API Keys

API keys are stored as environment variables. For local development, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_eleven_labs_api_key
```

For production deployments, these variables should be set in your hosting platform's environment configuration.

### Voice Configuration

The application currently uses Eleven Labs for voice synthesis. The voice ID and other parameters can be customized in `client/src/services/ElevenLabsService.ts`.

#### Voice ID

The voice ID is fixed to use a specific Eleven Labs voice. To change it, modify the `findBestMatchingVoice` method:

```typescript
// Change the fixed voice ID
private async findBestMatchingVoice(): Promise<string> {
  // Replace with your preferred voice ID from Eleven Labs
  return "ftDdhfYtmfGP0tFlBYA1";
}
```

To find other voice IDs:
1. Go to [Eleven Labs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library)
2. Select a voice you like
3. Click "Clone Voice" or check the URL which contains the voice ID

#### Voice Parameters

Voice quality parameters can be customized in the same file:

```typescript
private voicePreference: VoicePreference = {
  gender: 'female',        // 'male' or 'female'
  accent: 'Indian',        // 'American', 'British', 'Indian', etc.
  variation: true,         // Enable subtle variations for natural speech
  stability: 0.5,          // 0-1, higher is more stable, lower is more expressive
  similarity_boost: 0.75,  // 0-1, clarity and similarity to original voice
  style: 0.5,              // 0-1, style amount
  use_speaker_boost: true  // Improves quality for non-standard English
};
```

#### Voice Behavior Control

The application's voice behavior can be modified in `client/src/hooks/useChatbot.tsx`:

1. **Auto-speaking** (currently disabled): To re-enable automatic speaking when receiving messages, modify the `useEffect` hook that responds to message changes:

```typescript
// Scroll to bottom of messages when messages change
useEffect(() => {
  scrollToBottom();
  
  // Only speak the most recent assistant message when it's newly added
  const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
  if (lastMessage && lastMessage.role === 'assistant' && !isLoading) {
    // Use more natural speech with Eleven Labs
    // Adding a small delay to allow UI to finish rendering
    setTimeout(() => {
      elevenLabsService.speak(lastMessage.content);
    }, 300);
  }
}, [messages, isLoading]);
```

### LLM Configuration

The application uses Groq API for generating AI responses. The configuration can be customized in `server/services/openai.ts`.

#### Model Selection

The service tries multiple Groq models in order of preference:

```typescript
// Models to try in order of preference (first is primary, others are fallbacks)
const models = ["llama3-8b-8192", "mixtral-8x7b-32768", "gemma-7b-it"];
```

To change these models or their priority:
1. Edit the `models` array in the `generateChatResponse` function
2. Add new models from Groq's offerings or remove ones you don't want to use
3. The system will automatically try each model in sequence until one works

#### Response Parameters

You can adjust the AI response parameters:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  model: currentModel,
  messages: messages,
  max_tokens: 500,      // Maximum length of response
  temperature: 0.7      // Creativity level (higher = more creative, lower = more deterministic)
})
```

#### System Prompt

To change the AI's personality or behavior, modify the system message:

```typescript
const systemMessage = {
  role: "system",
  content: "You are a helpful medical front desk assistant. Be professional, concise, and friendly. " +
           "Your primary goal is to help patients with their medical queries and tasks."
};
```

## Deployment Guide for Vercel
